## 🌟 The Problem We Solve

When disasters strike, **infrastructure fails first**. Cell towers collapse, internet dies, power grids fail. Traditional emergency apps become useless exactly when you need them most. Current solutions require centralized infrastructure that simply doesn't exist in crisis situations.

**Real scenarios where BitGem saves lives:**
- 🌪️ Hurricane knocks out cell towers - families can't coordinate evacuation
- 🔥 Wildfire cuts internet - firefighters lose communication with command
- 🌊 Tsunami destroys infrastructure - rescue teams operate blind
- 🏚️ Building collapse - trapped victims can't call for help
